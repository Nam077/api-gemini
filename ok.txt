Create a professional 8s-second promotional video in Vietnamese, targeting individuals, students, freelancers, and small business owners who seek affordable AI tools and appreciate convenient, fast, and humorous advertisements. The video’s main message is "Ví bạn đang 'khóc thét' vì AI đắt đỏ? AItoolcheap: Nơi mua tài khoản AI RẺ BÈO nhèo, giúp ví bạn 'béo' lại ngay tức thì!", delivered with a humorous, lively, friendly, surprising, and unconventional tone, emphasizing the ease of buying AI accounts, the lowest market prices, freedom to use hot AI tools without financial strain, and AItoolcheap as a saving grace for AI enthusiasts on a tight budget. The visual and auditory elements must be entirely in Vietnamese.

The video opens with Scene 1, lasting from 0 to 3 seconds. The setting is a dim, melancholic indoor space, possibly a student's desk or a small home office, with a desaturated color palette and soft, gloomy lighting. The camera begins with a close-up on Anh Thủng Túi, a male character approximately 25-30 years old, wearing a simple t-shirt, jeans, and a casual hoodie, with subtle dark circles under his eyes, indicating weariness from financial stress. He is hunched over, clutching a visibly limp, empty wallet, his face scrunched in a miserable, desperate expression as he looks upwards in utter helplessness. An animated tear effect subtly drips from the wallet, emphasizing its "weeping" state. His body language conveys extreme frustration and despair, though tinged with a humorous resignation. As the camera slowly zooms out, Anh Thủng Túi exclaims with a bi-hài, despairing, and slightly high-pitched tone, "Trời ơi! AI đắt quá, ví tôi đang 'khóc thét' đây này!" The audio includes his dialogue and a faint, subtle weeping sound effect synchronized with the wallet's tears.

Transitioning instantly to Scene 2, from 3 to 6 seconds, a magical and surprising shift occurs. A sharp, clear "Ting!" sound effect rings out, signaling an unexpected appearance. The previously dim lighting abruptly brightens to a vibrant, magical glow, contrasting sharply with the previous scene. From behind Anh Thủng Túi, a modern "Thần Tài AI" character materializes within a shimmering, ethereal burst of light and a wisp of sparkling smoke. Thần Tài AI, a vibrant, energetic figure, possibly wearing a bright green hoodie or bomber jacket with a subtly stylized AI logo or a graphic of a full wallet, has a beaming, mischievous yet benevolent smile. He wears sleek, futuristic smart glasses and perhaps carries a small, subtle AI device. He extends one hand towards Anh Thủng Túi in a welcoming gesture, holding a visibly bulging, prosperous wallet or a golden, radiant AItoolcheap card in the other. His voice is clear, energetic, and optimistic, with a hint of initial mystery that quickly shifts to a friendly, witty tone. He asks with an intriguing, slightly playful inflection, "Ê bạn kia! Muốn ví 'béo' lại không?" The camera quickly pans and zooms into Thần Tài AI's sudden appearance, then settles into a medium shot capturing both characters, emphasizing the vibrant, contrasting lighting and the magical ambiance.

Scene 3, from 6 to 8 seconds, serves as the impactful resolution. Thần Tài AI, full of enthusiastic confidence and boundless energy, gently pats Anh Thủng Túi on the shoulder. His facial expression is one of triumphant joy as he then decisively points a finger towards an invisible screen in front of them, his smile radiating satisfaction. The visual immediately cuts to a dynamic display of the AItoolcheap.com website interface, showcasing its prominent logo and a bold, clear text overlay in Vietnamese proclaiming "RẺ NHẤT THỊ TRƯỜNG". Simultaneously, Anh Thủng Túi's previously deflated, empty wallet dramatically transforms onscreen into a visibly plump, overflowing one, accompanied by a satisfying "pop" sound effect. His face instantly lights up, eyes wide with sparkling joy and relief, his expression shifting from despair to absolute elation. A celebratory burst of colorful confetti erupts from the transformed wallet, enhancing the joyous atmosphere. Thần Tài AI's voice, now even more energetic and full of conviction, declares with a moderate speaking pace, emphasizing key words like "rẻ" and "béo", "Đến AItoolcheap.com ngay! Mua AI rẻ bèo, ví béo tròn!" The camera uses an over-the-shoulder shot initially to show the website, then quickly cuts to a close-up of Anh Thủng Túi's joyous reaction, followed by a dynamic zoom out to encompass both characters reveling in the successful outcome, with a cheerful, upbeat musical score building to a crescendo, accompanied by the sounds of the wallet transformation and confetti. The overall video quality should be professional-grade, ensuring crisp visuals, fluid animations, and high-fidelity audio, making every Vietnamese visual and auditory element clear and impactful for commercial advertising.
